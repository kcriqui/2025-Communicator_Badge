## Here be dragons.  You probably just want to use the included lvgl-micropython binary that's tested and verified to work with the badge:
# lvgl_micropy_ESP32_GENERIC_S3-SPIRAM_OCT-16.bin

## But here's how we built it.

## Build uses lvgl_micropython: https://github.com/lvgl-micropython/lvgl_micropython

## We got our screen driver accepted, so it should be an "easy" build now.
## in firmware directory
git clone https://github.com/lvgl-micropython/lvgl_micropython
cd lvgl_micropython
#  our board will be N16R8 : 16 megs quad flash, 8 megs octal spi psram 
python3 make.py esp32 BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=SPIRAM_OCT --flash-size=16 DISPLAY=nv3007 --enable-uart-repl=y --enable-cdc-repl=n 

## This will download a bunch of dependencies and start the compilation, but it will fail.
## upstream micropython has a bug 

# apply the patch to make micropython compile with GCC 15
cp ../inline_thumb_patch lib/micropython/
cd lib/micropython/
patch -p1 < inline_thumb_patch
## verify that it fixed the inline thumb by adding __attribute__((nonstring))
git diff py/emitinlinethumb.c

#  try compile again
#  It will get farther, after downloading a whole bunch more
cd ../..
python3 make.py esp32 BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=SPIRAM_OCT --flash-size=16 DISPLAY=nv3007 --enable-uart-repl=y --enable-cdc-repl=n 

## This time, it should work.  
## Note that because the build is so large, it will complain about having to re-adjust partitions.  Don't sweat it.
## Find your binary in build/lvgl_micropy_ESP32_GENERIC_S3-SPIRAM_OCT-16.bin
ls build

## We're also using some other "frozen"-in compiled libraries: 
### still from firmware/lvgl_micropython directory
## pull down micropython-lib into parent firmware directory
#
# at the moment, nothing from micropython-lib, but we'll keep this here just in case
# git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/ ../micropython-lib

## Frozen in ucryptography lib for command signing
git clone https://github.com/dmazzella/ucryptography.git ../ucryptography
pushd ../ucryptography && git submodule update --init --depth 1 && popd

python3 make.py esp32 BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=SPIRAM_OCT --flash-size=16 DISPLAY=nv3007 --enable-uart-repl=y --enable-cdc-repl=n 
# FROZEN_MANIFEST=../hackaday_frozen_manifest.py 
# strange problem with the below, which should work: do not!  file bug report later.

## flash it with esptool:
# if it already has a micropython on it...  
mpremote bootloader  && sleep 2s
## if not, put board into bootloader mode: bridge boot pin and hit reset.  release boot pin.
## then flash
esptool --port /dev/ttyACM0 erase-flash
esptool --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 1500000 write-flash 0 build/lvgl_micropy_ESP32_GENERIC_S3-SPIRAM_OCT-16.bin
